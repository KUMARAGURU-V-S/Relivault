# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing EfficientDisasterRelief smart contract to include automatic disbursal capabilities with comprehensive validation. The enhancement will add automated validation of IPFS CID integrity, victim wallet address verification, and disbursal amount logic, along with an auto-disbursal mechanism that can automatically process approved claims when all validation criteria are met. The goal is to streamline the relief distribution process while maintaining security and gas efficiency.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a contract administrator, I want the system to automatically validate IPFS CIDs for claim documents, so that I can ensure document integrity and authenticity before processing claims.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a claim is submitted with an IPFS CID THEN the system SHALL validate that the CID format is correct and follows IPFS standards
2. WHEN a claim document CID is validated THEN the system SHALL store a validation timestamp and status
3. IF an invalid CID format is provided THEN the system SHALL reject the claim submission with an appropriate error message
4. WHEN CID validation occurs THEN the system SHALL emit an event indicating validation status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a contract administrator, I want the system to verify victim wallet addresses against a whitelist or validation criteria, so that funds are only disbursed to legitimate disaster victims.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a claim is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate that the claimant address meets victim verification criteria
2. WHEN an address is verified as a legitimate victim THEN the system SHALL mark the address as validated in the contract state
3. IF an unverified address attempts to submit a claim THEN the system SHALL reject the claim with an appropriate error message
4. WHEN address validation occurs THEN the system SHALL emit an event with validation details

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a contract administrator, I want the system to automatically calculate and validate disbursal amounts based on predefined logic, so that relief distribution follows consistent and fair criteria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a claim is approved THEN the system SHALL calculate the disbursal amount based on predefined algorithms and available funds
2. WHEN disbursal amount is calculated THEN the system SHALL ensure it does not exceed the contract's available balance
3. IF the calculated amount exceeds available funds THEN the system SHALL adjust the amount proportionally or queue the claim
4. WHEN amount validation occurs THEN the system SHALL store the calculation details and reasoning

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a disaster victim, I want the system to automatically disburse approved funds for low-risk amounts when all validation criteria are met, so that I can receive relief quickly without manual intervention delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all validation criteria are met for an approved claim with low-risk amount THEN the system SHALL automatically initiate fund disbursal
2. WHEN a claim amount is below the low-risk threshold THEN the system SHALL process auto-disbursal without additional verification
3. WHEN auto-disbursal is triggered THEN the system SHALL verify contract balance sufficiency before transfer
4. IF auto-disbursal fails for any reason THEN the system SHALL revert the claim status and emit a failure event
5. WHEN auto-disbursal completes successfully THEN the system SHALL update claim status and emit success events

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an NGO administrator, I want high-risk amount claims to require manual verification before disbursal, so that large fund distributions are properly reviewed and authorized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a claim amount exceeds the high-risk threshold THEN the system SHALL require NGO verification before disbursal
2. WHEN an NGO verifies a high-risk claim THEN the system SHALL record the verification details and authorizing NGO address
3. IF a high-risk claim lacks NGO verification THEN the system SHALL prevent auto-disbursal and require manual approval
4. WHEN NGO verification is completed THEN the system SHALL allow disbursal to proceed with all standard validations
5. WHEN high-risk disbursal occurs THEN the system SHALL emit events indicating NGO verification details

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a contract administrator, I want to configure risk thresholds for automatic vs manual disbursal, so that the system can adapt to different disaster scenarios and fund availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the contract is deployed THEN the system SHALL have configurable low-risk and high-risk amount thresholds
2. WHEN risk thresholds are updated THEN the system SHALL only allow authorized administrators to modify these values
3. WHEN a claim amount is evaluated THEN the system SHALL correctly categorize it as low-risk or high-risk based on current thresholds
4. WHEN threshold changes occur THEN the system SHALL emit events indicating the new threshold values

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a contract user, I want the enhanced contract to be gas-optimized, so that transaction costs remain reasonable for all participants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN contract functions are executed THEN the system SHALL minimize gas consumption through efficient code patterns
2. WHEN multiple validations occur THEN the system SHALL batch operations where possible to reduce gas costs
3. WHEN storage operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use packed structs and efficient data types
4. WHEN the contract is deployed THEN the system SHALL demonstrate improved gas efficiency compared to the current version

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a contract administrator, I want comprehensive event logging for all validation and disbursal activities, so that I can audit and monitor the system's operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any validation occurs THEN the system SHALL emit detailed events with validation results
2. WHEN auto-disbursal is attempted THEN the system SHALL log the attempt with all relevant parameters
3. WHEN errors occur during validation or disbursal THEN the system SHALL emit error events with diagnostic information
4. WHEN contract state changes occur THEN the system SHALL provide complete audit trail through events
5. WHEN NGO verification occurs THEN the system SHALL log the verifying NGO address and verification timestamp
